<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br />

<p align="center">
  This project is about building a website with just html, css, bootstrap and javascript by following a Figma design project.
</p>

<br />

## What to do

<br />

<p>
    In this project, you will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

    You will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

    You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

    You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.
